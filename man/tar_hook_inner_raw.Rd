\title{Hook to wrap dependencies (raw version)}
\usage{
tar_hook_inner_raw(
  targets,
  hook,
  names = NULL,
  names_wrap = NULL,
  set_deps = TRUE,
  envir = parent.frame()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{targets}{A list of target objects. The input target list
can be arbitrarily nested, but it must consist entirely of target
objects. In addition, the return value is a simple list
where each element is a target object.
All hook functions remove the nested structure of the input target list.}

\item{hook}{Pre-quoted language object with
R code to wrap each target's command.
The hook must contain the special placeholder symbol \code{.x}
so \code{tar_hook_inner()} knows where to insert the code to wrap
mentions of dependencies.}

\item{names}{Name of targets in the target list
to apply the hook. Supplied as a language object with a
\code{tidyselect} expression: for example, \code{names = quote(starts_with("x_"))}.
Targets not included in \code{names} still remain in the target list,
but they are not modified because the hook does not apply to them.}

\item{names_wrap}{Pre-quoted language object with
names of targets to wrap with the hook
where they appear as dependencies in the commands of other targets.
Use \code{tidyselect} expressions, e.g.
\code{names_wrap = quote(starts_with("your_prefix_"))}.}

\item{set_deps}{Logical of length 1, whether to refresh the dependencies
of each modified target by scanning the newly generated
target commands for dependencies. If \code{FALSE}, then the target will
keep the original set of dependencies it had before the hook.
Set to \code{NULL} to include all targets supplied to the \code{targets} argument.
\code{TRUE} is recommended for nearly all situations. Only use \code{FALSE}
if you have a specialized use case and you know what you are doing.}

\item{envir}{Optional environment to construct the quosure for the \code{names}
argument to select names.}
}
\value{
A flattened list of target objects with the hooks applied.
Even if the input target list had a nested structure,
the return value is a simple list where each element is a target object.
All hook functions remove the nested structure of the input target list.
}
\description{
In the command of each target, wrap each mention of
each dependency target in an arbitrary R expression.
\code{\link[=tar_hook_inner_raw]{tar_hook_inner_raw()}} is like \code{\link[=tar_hook_inner]{tar_hook_inner()}} except
that the \code{hook}, \code{names}, and \code{names_wrap} arguments are
pre-quoted language objects.
}
\details{
The expression you supply to \code{hook}
must contain the special placeholder symbol \code{.x}
so \code{tar_hook_inner()} knows where to insert the original command
of the target.

\section{Target objects}{

Most \code{tarchetypes} functions are target factories,
which means they return target objects
or lists of target objects.
Target objects represent skippable steps of the analysis pipeline
as described at \url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/}.
Please read the walkthrough at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html}
to understand the role of target objects in analysis pipelines.

For developers,
\url{https://wlandau.github.io/targetopia/contributing.html#target-factories}
explains target factories (functions like this one which generate targets)
and the design specification at
\url{https://books.ropensci.org/targets-design/}
details the structure and composition of target objects.
